Some crap.\n\nSome of his complaints about language usability are easily solved with trivial macros or programming creativity.\n\nThe complaint about parallel programming is almost complete crap.  CPUs optimize parallel code in all but the more complicated intents, which shouldn't need to be \"easy by design\".\n\nI'd rather use C than Erlang because I'm not looking to learn a new language whose biggest feature is parallel programming.\n\nI'd rather use C than Haskell in a critical project because I don't want to worry about getting my mind around Monads just to implement state, a feature critical to almost every nontrivial program.  \n\nWhy should I use C?  Because I can implement objects in less lines of C code than it takes for me to implement variables in Haskell.  Because I can implement almost any functionality in C that those language have, if I'm willing to give up on Syntactic sugar.  I like Haskell a lot, but it's not often the right tool for the job.  When C is the wrong tool for the job, it's an extra hundred lines of code.  When Haskell is the wrong tool for the job, it's a matter of wrapping the philosophical ideology around the program.\n\nI am still more frustrated by monads in Haskell, after reading a dozen articles, than I was the first time I saw a char * * * foo;.\n\nDo I use C?  Not really.  It's still my best backup for when the program is simple and has to run fast.  I'm stuck using Perl day-to-day because it's the \"best tool for the job\" (combine the triviality of the job with regexps with the fact that it's the only language the entire department knows).  I use Lisp and Haskell at home.  I still think C is taking a bad rap on these one-sided arguments.  Speed isn't the *only* reason to use C.

If you saw some of the code I see daily, it's clear that your average coder has no idea, for example, why in Java to use a StringBuffer instead of + for joining strings.\n\n2. Like it or not, it will be around forever.    A friend of mine writes video codecs, entirely in C, then optimizes in assembler.  For this task there's no better tool.

By raising a kid you implicitly take a hand in determining the direction of the entire human race.\n\nAs I said, bikes and cars only put a very few people at risk at any one time, but raising another Pol Pot, or Cheney, or Kim-Jong Il has exactly the same effect, and more, to thousands or millions of people.\n\nI understand that killing people who are already alive is bad (obviously), and that pretty much everyone (present US administration aside) subscribes to the idea of inalienable human rights - I also do.\n\nWhat I'm not so clear on is why having children is one of these inalienable human rights - you can live a perfectly fulfilled life without siring offspring (no-one's saying don't have sex, or offer to help with other people's kids).\n\nWe already routinely screen child-care workers, teachers, babysitters and the like to determine if they're \"suitable\" to work with kids... but we don't screen the one or two people who spend the vast majority of their time with the child, and from whom the child derives the majority of their young experience and opinions - whether educational or traumatising.\n\nWe also ban paedophiles (for example) from any contact with children... and yet someone who picks up their baby in a fit of pique and uses it to club their partner in the head, fracturing the kids skull and putting its very *life* at risk... is free to go on banging out sprogs as long as she wants.\n\nYou've probably guessed by now that I'm playing devil's advocate, but I'm still curious to see if anyone can give me a good answer.\n\nI take your point about the risk of letting in eugenics by the back-door... but why does the determining factor have to be anything controversial?\n\nBefore you're allowed to have a kid you have to take a few parenting classes, you have to demonstrate you have the material resources to care for this kid *in addition to* any you already have, and you perhaps have to undergo a short counselling course to make sure you want to have a kid for the right reasons (ie, because you want to raise one, not because you're trying to save a marriage, or need someone to bully, or want a bigger welfare cheque).\n\nFail the tests (or pass them and then mistreat your kid) and you lose the right to any more, either for a defined period and/or until you reapply and pass the test again.\n\nNone of these things should reasonably prevent someone from having at least one or two kids - even families on welfare can afford to raise a couple of kids.\n\nWhat it will do is stop people having kids for the wrong reasons, having more kids than they can reasonably support, and it'll emphasize that having kids should be an honour and an obligation to treat the kid right, not a god-given right you can abuse at will, or a route to a larger state handout.\n\nAs I said, I don't fully believe this - it's a hypothetical thought experiment... but what's wrong with it?"},{"author":"leokennis","body":"I *shiver* went to Digg and found:\r\n\r\n-Screenshots of uninteresting game\r\n-Links to linkfarm weblogs\r\n-More crap"},{"author":"rubenshakkamacher","body":"Lucid dreaming is certainly not nonsense, but corporeal manifestation of something in the dream is.

Memory use should be only the size of the working set unless the programmer chooses to trade memory resizing for performance.\n\nAlas, all languages i know of are sorely lacking in one (or more) of these departments, so you'll still have to use the right tool for the job -- there's no silver programming language bullet, yet.\n\n\"When C is better\n\nIt isn't all roses, of course. The C quicksort uses an extremely ingenious technique, invented by Hoare, whereby it sorts the array in place; that is, without using any extra storage. As a result, it runs quickly, and in a small amount of memory. In contrast, the Haskell program allocates quite a lot of extra memory behind the scenes, and runs rather slower than the C program.\n\nIn effect, the C quicksort does some very ingenious storage management, trading this algorithmic complexity for a reduction in run-time storage management costs.\n\nIn applications where performance is required at any cost, or when the goal is detailed tuning of a low-level algorithm, an imperative language like C would probably be a better choice than Haskell, exactly because it provides more intimate control over the exact way in which the computation is carried out.\""},{"author":"masta","body":" looks like the new problem so far is people who post the annoying political reddits are simply putting them in the main reddit.

I'm also not talking about rendering the offender sterile of anything permanent - simply ban them from having children, with immediate adoption of the child and *incredibly* harsh punishment for anyone who violates the ban.\n\nPeople can use birth control if they want, or they can simply refrain from penetrative sex.  Either way, they are no longer allowed to be the primary caregiver of a child, since they have proven themselves unworthy of the honour.\n\nWe ban people from driving who have abused the privilege, and that's not *really* all that dangerous.  Why not ban people from having another kid, if they've already proven themselves incapable of the job?\n\n&gt; The same thing happened with \"literacy tests\" that blacks had to take to vote. Imagine how a parent test could be distorted to reinforce social institutions and prevent people that society doesn't like from breeding!\n\nFair point.  But generally as a society we already have a system which assesses if someone's a \"bad parent\", and removes the kid if so.  What's so hard about removing a kid and then banning the offender from having any more?\n\n&gt; The only way I could see it working is if you had some sort of genetic criteria for reproducing, and, while it could work, I have a feeling that people couldn't get eugenics out of their minds for long enough to even consider it.\n\nWhy such basic and genetic conditions?  I'm talking about being financially able to support another kid (in addition to any they've already got), not having any prior convictions for child-abuse or domestic violence, maybe undergoing a short course of parenting and anger-management classes, and a short course of counseling to ensure they're having kids for the right reasons (\"because I want to raise a child well\", rather than \"this will save my marriage\" or \"this will get us a bigger welfare cheque\").\n\nAs i mentioned in the other post, I'm playing devil's advocate here - I don't honestly believe that this is necessarily the way forward, but I'm curious as to why everyone's *so* against they'll refuse to even contemplate the hypothetical scenario.\n\nIt appears we've hit upon another of society's irrational taboos, and people would rather downmod-and-forget than discuss it openly. &lt;:-)"},{"author":"diatribal2","body":"pics or it didnt' happen\n\n\nno yellow pls"},{"author":"cartooncorpse","body":"i wonder how many of the acts go completely unreported.\n\nsheesh with all those 'to catch a predator' customers, there must be a bunch of teens who are actually into that sort of thing."},{"author":"oditogre","body":" Individual scroll bars on comments: +1\n\nAjaxy posting / editing so you don't lose your place in thread: +1\n\n'Load More Comments' / 'Continue This Thread -&gt;': -1.\n\nOn the whole, I think it's a net improvement, but the 'Load More Comments' thing is pretty annoying, especially the freeze-ups.

But, curiously, he makes no appearance in the ultimatum game, a classic economics experiment.\n\nIn this game, two players, a proposer and a responder, divide a reward. It could be a cake. It could be cash. It could even be a bunch of grapes. The game is so named because the proposition is an ultimatum. The responder can either accept the division or reject it. If he rejects it, both players receive nothing.\n\nHomo economicus would accept any division in which his share was not zero. But that is not what happens. Scores of studies have run the ultimatum game across cultures and ages. Universally, people reject any share lower than 20%—apparently to punish the greed of the proposer. People do not act like Homo economicus. Instead, they are the arbiters of fairness.\n\n"},{"author":"oditogre","body":"Ummm...try going there *without* bugmenot.

As you say, Reddit no longer has the option 'also submit to Reddit.com' when submitting to a subreddit. Effectively, for submissions, reddit.com has become another subreddit, a catch-all category. Also, as you point out, the page Reddit.com is the old my.reddit, i.e. it only shows stories from our selected subreddits. This has the potential to return our Reddit experience to something sane, by also implementing these steps:\n\n\nAdd an 'other' subreddit, for articles that don't fit any other category, to replace Reddit.com in the 'submit' dialog.\n\nNote in Rediquette that it is acceptable or encouraged to downvote for miscategorisation.\n\nWhat are the effects of this? If I have a story, say \"Bush administration does bad thing\", I will now have a strong incentive to post to politics subreddit. If I don't, it's just in the 'other' category and liable not to get too much notice. \n\nIf I am a non-politics-liking Redditor, I will no longer see that post. \n\nNote that this would work as is, without any further change, if we just start to think in this way and mod accordingly.\n\nWhile doing that, it would be good to reinstate features subreddit, for all discussion of Reddit itself.\n\nAnd as a discussion point, maybe a poll.reddit is called for too.

Ok you don't have a closures, the memory business is still manual (even if with good libraries and valgrind it's much simpler than raw C), and so on, but using 'structures' and a good dose of functional approach and bottom-up design you can write good modular C programs that are simple to develop, read, fix.\n\nSo... if the difference gets smaller you start *seriously* to see the good points of C: it's fast, the interface with the operating system is not mediated, there are **static checks!** when you compile. If everything compiles well and you test the application there are very little chances that the user will see a runtime error because a name of a var was a typo.\n\nThere are even advantages that are about being low-level: programmers able good C programs care a lot about a data structure being O(1) or O(N^2) in certain kind of operations, it's like if every part of the program is written with more \"computer science\" in mind.\n\nI think this all the reasons why in pratice a lot of the best software available is written  in C.

Nor would many argue that mankind doesn't contribute to the problem.\n\nThe gulf between the left and right on this issue is not so much focussed around assessment of the problem as future solutions. Left-wingers tend to favour more national and international quotas, demand reduction, eco-taxes and subsidies, etc -- generally, \"big government solutions\". Right-wingers tend to favour market based approaches, technological \"fixes\" (e.g. deflecting light from the sun to reduce the amount impacting upon Earth -- see editorial in today's WSJ), and in some sense wishful (although some would say relatively reasonable) thinking (e.g. Lomborg and the notion that increasing temperature means more arable land).\n\nGiven that the evaluation of policy proscriptions, whether right- or left-wing, can take many years to effect, and they are subject to considerable uncertainty, I would say that the issue is indeed debatable, and is far from \"down-in-the-mud, God-given, use-your-brain, fucking common sense\".

It is not a charity, so their test demonstrating people's reasoning with the \"save children\" donation is not an accurate representation of what we're seeing here.  Why are they different?  With a donation charity such as the one described, the benefit to cost ratio for an individual is so close to zero (the nigh imperceptible, though admittedly real, benefit to the whole of society), that there is no immediate benefit to the donator himself for giving the money.    \n\n\nRadiohead's \"tip\" system is something else entirely.  Yes, currency is something you exchange for goods and services.  That we know.  From that point of view, paying less is always better for the consumer.  But currency is also a vote, a statement of endorsement.  It's a Pavlovian instigator for service rendered.  \n\nI tip the hairstylist after a good cut.  She's rewarded for good action.  She's more likely to try harder with my hair in the future.  By association, that connection is also demonstrated in front of her compatriots.  So they too are likely to make the association between good cut (extra effort) and good money.\n\nIt's also a vote for non-tip payment events.  For example, there's now a chance of a Serenity 2 because the first run of Serenity dvd's sold out.  Company sees profitability, hence is more likely to follow up with similar content.  A very successful movie of type A is likely to generate additional movies of type A from other directors as well.\n\nWhen we pay for downloading Radiohead's music, it's a vote.  We are voting for a system, a system which we hope to be implemented in a broader scale.

This article is extremely poorly written, *not* thought invoking, and entirely misrepresents the idea of stopping time.  Here is a little exert to show what i mean:\n\n&gt;What superpower would I have? Immediately the first thing that came to mind was the ability to pause time, similar to the Japanese guy in Heroes. Can you imagine how great it would be to have that superpower? I could potentially stay in bed for hours, press play when I wanted to go to work and pause time again for an extended three hours lunch break. More importantly, I could rob banks and make myself filthy rich and never have to work again. Nobody would see me. I could even be a good Samaritan and pause time as someone was about to get hit by a car, dive heroically pushing them out of the way and save them from certain death.\n\n&gt;However, being the nerd that I am I started to see the shortcomings in this superpower. It would mess up my body clock. The world would think its 8am and my body would think it is 11am. I would start to fall asleep at 7pm or 8pm. That wouldn’t be much fun especially if I was planning a night out away from my computer screen. Perhaps a night in front of the TV instead.\n\n&gt;Secondly, if I pause time, will it just be people who pause or will machines pause as well? Will the CCTV keep running as I rob Chase Manhattan Bank for the second time? If machines pause as well, will that mean that the electrons that power my electricity will stop spinning?\n\n&gt;I would no longer be able to spend countless hours on Facebook, Reddit and You Tube. My BitTorrent downloads would cease! Oh the pain! It was time to find a new superpower as I twisted and turned in my bed.\n\nStopping time.  How would this mess with your biological clock?  stop time again and get a full nights rest, fuck around until your perceived time matches up with the actual time, and then start time again.  not a hard concept.  Also, of course machines would stop too.  Stopping time is not the same as stopping people; everything ceases to move (including those little electrons and shit that power this fag's computer, so i guess he can't fucking poke people on facebook).  When you would start time, it would be as if it was never stopped, so electronics wouldn't shut down.\n\nThe part of this superpower that gets me is vision.  Our eyes capture and interpret reflected light into images.  If light stops moving, how would we see?\n\nneedless to say, this article got a downmod from me.

It infuriates Republicans that Gore receives so much recognition (culminating in his shared Nobel prize) for what they perceive to be, well, doing nothing. Gore is a talker, a champion of causes, but the fact that he gets so much recognition for this, instead of the \"doers\" (scientists, researchers), clashes with conservative values. This is why he got jumped all over for the (incorrect) quote about inventing the internet, because it proves their point that he's just out to puff up his chest and steal the limelight from the people that matter.\n\n \n2. Global Warming awareness seeks to limit your (and businesses) freedom to do whatever the hell you want...and Al Gore is the face of this cause. \"How dare Al Gore tell me I have to stop driving my Tahoe!\" Repubs think responsibility for climate change should be up to the individual, not government regulation.\n\n3.

It's a donation to an organization. The mental hurdle here is that they make a \"profit\" off of their loans. But your money (and its accumulated profit) is reinvested. I suppose they could offer you the money back with some interest, but that would decrease their lending pool and thus decrease the value of your original donated dollar. It would be as if you gave less in the first place.\r\n\r\nNow, you are right that the profit incentive is powerful, and there are some for-profit systems that operate in this manner, such as Grameen Bank. However, these institutions are also less willing to take on risk, and more likely to charge higher rates, which partially defeats the charitable purpose.

Do you guys find odd that Democrats give support to poor and middle class people while Republicans rive support to the rich, and since there are a lot of poor and middle class than there is rich that Republicans can still compete in elections? \n\nOne reason for this problem is due to the fact that many poor people dont vote.  Even without counting that fact, there should still be an overwhelming amount of people in middle class and poor class that do vote.  \n\nIt is obvious that there are many poor and middle class people that does not support the government that supports them.  I call these people the 'stupid people.'\n\nMy theory is that republicans rely on these stupid people for office.  They want to protect the right for Americans to be stupid.  This will explain a couple of things.  Education is always on the bottom of the list of things to do for Republicans.  They want to constantly cut school fundings.  This will ensure that the most of the Americans that rely on public education to remain stupid and ignorant.  \n\nThis also explains why Republicans hate Gore.  Since Gore has the IQ to be a genius (if he was to be president he would have been the smartest President we've ever had), the republicans despise him.  For one, whether if he is a president or a Nobel Peace Prize winner, people may idolize him or may even aspire to be like him.

Is it wrong to see evolution as God's creation?  Is it wrong to appreciate the universe as divinely created or managed?  Who cares if someone believes that evolution was \"guided\" by God through the natural laws we have deduced?

It would be tempting to attribute the decline in production of mercury to this factor. Mercury is a toxic metal which has been substituted with various other materials and devices and it is now slowly disappearing from the market. But most of the legislation forbidding the use of mercury came much later than the mercury peak (1962) and, as we saw, mercury peaked almost exactly at the “midpoint” of the available reserves, as predicted by the standard Hubbert model. A similar case, reduction in the demand, can be made for the peaking of lead, another poisonous metal. But for many applications, for instance car batteries, no substitute has been found so far for lead.

Ron Paul has taken 1st place in no fewer than 16 straw polls around the nation.\n\nAs another reporter, Denny Jackson, in the StatesmanJournal noted today:\n\n&gt; Oregon Republicans got a wake-up call when their straw poll at the Portland World Trade Center was transformed into a Ron Paul rally, and his supporters crushed the opposition in the poll.\n&gt; About 100 Paul supporters brought signs and banners, waved at traffic and pedestrians for blocks around the center, handed out literature and ended up putting Ron Paul in the winner's seat with 67 percent of the vote. Other candidates couldn't generate enough enthusiasm to get anyone at all to come out with any visible support.\n&gt; Instead of ignoring or opposing Paul's efforts as they have done to date, the Republican Party leadership should be asking themselves what it is about this man that brings so many people out of their comfortable homes and hobbies to volunteer to campaign for him when other politicians are looked upon as something nasty that got on their shoe.\n&gt; Here's a little hint for them: Ron Paul is today's Thomas Jefferson.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nDuane Johnson\nProvo, Utah"},{"author":"marm0lade","body":"Next time you want to patronize conservatives, don't be such a dick."},{"author":"americanuck","body":"Yeah it won't be so funny when we invade/bomb you though."},{"author":"fishyf","body":"aaah greed."},{"author":"joe90210","body":"omg sweet, time to conquer the world lolz"},{"author":"washcapsfan37","body":"Yeah, looks like if you have non-uniform salary you just have to do some estimations over the entire month/year."},{"author":"drosser","body":"He's not a Jester, he's a Fool.\n    \n    \nBig\n    \nDifference"},{"author":"sketerpot","body":"Logic, science, and that illogical statement he made are mutually exclusive."},{"author":"redditcensoredme","body":" My definition **is** correct.

I don't even say theorems, because quantum theory doesn't prove anything (not like the Lagrange theorem does). It is supposed to be a model for the real world. And as far as *that* is concerned, it is unfortunately gibberish.\n\n&gt;Something being empirical doesn't make it true.\n\n I don't think it's so much being empirical as much as the fact that if your goal is to model reality, then you must be able to check your model *against* reality.\n\n As for your remark on Quantum Theory being gibberish, I state that it's quite the opposite. The simple existence of mirrors, or tinted glass which cannot be explained in classical physics or any other theory that I know of, or even the transistor which powers the computer you are typing on right now are explained by the model called Quantum Theory (tunneling). The double slit experiment is irrefutable: it happens every time (wave). The fact that one part of this model can explain daily phenomena doesn't require that the other parts of this model be in any way intuitive. It is only required that this model never be contradicted, which so far, it hasn't been substantially.  \n\n (And then there's the whole fact that String theory would encompass quantum theory...)\n\n Remember that quantum theory has some extremely simple historic underpinnigs. Underpinnings from observations made in the late 19th century when there wasn't any fancy tools for experimenting with. The speed of light, the weight of atoms etc, were all derived from very clearly observable phenomena that aren't at all secretly hidden behind vaults... They are all a natural movement forward from what Maxwell discovered. QM isn't even Relativistic, meaning that ironically, QM didn't come as a quantum leap. It simply evolved from Bohr's atom which evolved from Maxwell's equations.\n\n All in all, the fact that you detect loads of post-modernism in QM is both anachronistic and plain ill informed."},{"author":"boirun03","body":"good mp4 to mp3 article"},{"author":"nmrk","body":"-1 Stealth link to Ron Paul article."},{"author":"DrewInBalto","body":"I was going to put it on a blog and elaborate, but I figured this way would be more efficient. \n\nThe prescription drug benefit prohibits the government from negotiating price with the pharmaceutical companies; they can name their price.

So, perhaps the innovation that the Chinese are historically legendary will once again rise to the surface.

Before I switched to Linux (topical because I have stopped using my computer as a gaming machine and play games on consoles now), I had at least 20 games installed that I hadn't paid for, and a few of them were notorious for their crippling DRM.  What is really sad is that the games that had the worst DRM were the least popular games.  It seems like the better the game was the less intrusive the DRM was (if any was present).  \n\nAlso, while I won't justify pirating software, this issue is just like the music and movie industry.  If game publishers were putting out better games there would be more people buying them.  You can wrap up your \"intellectual property\" in as much DRM as you like, but it doesn't change the fact that your product is shitty.

From what I understand, string theory is on a very slippery slope right now. Who cares? It does not impact the lives of your average individual on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nFor some of us, global warming isn't common sense.  It is a theory based on science that is very \"large.\"  By \"large\" I mean that the scope of the data is well beyond the scope of mankind and that usually means a lot of wild ass guesses.\r\n\r\nI used string theory and dark matter as examples because they are also part of a \"large\" science where people are guessing.  Educated guesses to be sure, by smarter people than I - to be sure.  But still guesses that can be, and because of the poor data available often are, wrong.\r\n\r\nAnother analogy I consider useful is dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs were considered to be [REPTILES](http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573347/Dinosaur.html) when I was in school.  But now scientists believe they are actually [AVIAN](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/avians.html). \r\n\r\nHeck, [we don't even have a good grasp of how MAN came to exist yet](http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/fossil-find-changes-apeman-story/2007/08/22/1187462353535.html), but Hansen and his gang are SURE of global temperatures millions of years ago. \r\n\r\nThat alone should kick in a little skepticism.  Anyone purporting to KNOW what the average global temperature was thousands and millions of years ago, and UNWILLING TO CONSIDER ANY OTHER VIEW should set off the same alarms that a fundamentalist Christian sets off in many of you.  People who \"just know\" scare me.\r\n\r\nGlobal warming is a BELIEF, not a proven fact.\r\n\r\n&gt;I don't think you are a moron, unless you look at the satellite images of the ice on this planet over the past 20 years and say \"no problem.\" Then, I question your rationality.\r\n\r\nI'd defend that rationality.  \r\n\r\nFirst, I'd point out that we don't have much data and we don't know how often this has happened before without man's input.\r\n\r\nSecond, I'd want to know if the Sun is involved.  If so, we may not be able to affect it and we may not be causing or significantly contributing to it.  Man's ego is often greater than his impact.\r\n\r\nThirdly, I'd say - \"Hey, let's look at this and let's make reasonable and rational changes to our lifestyles, but let's not run off willy nilly with mandatory caps on this and that, and force people and businesses to do things that don't make financial sense.\r\n\r\nI'm for tax credits and incentives to reduce carbon dioxide output and overall environmental responsibility.

It must be dealt with specially because of the First Amendment. The school officials are clearly not allowed to get involved in religious speech, as that would be a situation where it would be accused of favoring a particular religion. *But*, the school provides many places where students can express themselves - every piece of written work and every platform where a student can speak. The First Amendment forbids the school from prohibiting religious expression in these arenas. So the school is in a bind here - how does it reconcile these two simultaneous requirements? This bill seems to strike a reasonable balance to me.\n\n&gt; \"here you are under our guidance and speak \n&gt; in the areas we say\".\n\nThe school can set policies restricting speech specifically where it disrupts the learning environment.

To \"cash out\" someone, be they the government whose money you are holding or some other party, has to pay you for the money you are selling.\n\nChina \"buys\" dollars and \"sells\" dollars, as you do when you go to the store, even though it may not seem like you are.  If China came to the U.S. tomorrow, and said \"here's your money back, we'd like some gold/silver/whatever\" there's no way the U.S. could make that payment, it's just too big.  The failure to pay would destroy the US's credit rating, as people would assume that their dollars were worthless.  At this point, China hasn't sold their dollars (or was only able to sell a fraction of them before the economy crashed), and so the rest are worthless.  They have lost their investment.\n\nThis is why it is absolutely against China's interests to do this on a very basic level.  There are other reason's too (the ripple effect of a massive US crash would likely destroy other economies, even if they weren't holding dollars), but the fact that China *has* so many dollars means it would be suicide if they started selling them en masse.\n\nIf China thinks that the U.S. is a bad investment, they'll start holding something else, like the Euro.  But even if they do make a transition, they'll be very very careful how they do it, as they'd still be in the hole if the dollar drops.   "},{"author":"WallPhone","body":"The single still is classic.

Which, of course, is that the federal government should not be involved. It is an issue for the states: the more divisive the issue, the more local should be the solution.\n\n2. Religion is a national issue and should take a back seat to our responsibility in the global community. There are more important things at stake right now. Our country kidnaps, holds people without trial and tortures. Our president monitors phone calls and searches our property without warrants.

I responded that a) that is not a very good reason to suspect him of this behavior, and b) even if his staffers posted multiple all the videos on youtube, he still has incredible internet popularity evidenced by the movies' hits, search terms, and blog chatter.\n\nAfter that, you insinuated that I didn't read the article. I countered by quoting the article. Then you appealed to the authority of the professor. I pointed out your logical flaw. Finally, you suggested that I read the article, again, in a condescending manner. I pointed out that I had read the article, and that you still weren't responding appropriately.\n\nNow we're up to the present.\n\nYou still haven't responded to:\na) the fact that multiple users posting Ron Paul videos doesn't necessarily mean they were employed by Ron Paul to do so, or\nb) regardless of who posted the videos on youtube, Ron Paul's support on the internet is undeniable and backed up by several metrics.\n\nYou posted another comment, so I'll respond to that too:\n&gt; But do you want a candidate (or a Congressman, for this matter) who lying about his campaign? Or didn't raise his voice against spamming polls and discussion boards on the scale never seen before?\n\nFor your first question, you're assuming that the article is valid; as I pointed out earlier, it's not. For your second question, I don't see how Ron Paul has any obligation to *stop his supporters from registering their support*. Unless you are insinuating that Ron Paul paid these people to vote for him in internet polls, he certainly hasn't done anything wrong.

Were murderers shunned, for instance? I was surprised when he told me the code. \"It doesn't matter what you did, as long as you don't hurt a kid.\" He told me that, according to a criminal ethic, even a murderer might be justified in killing. Even killers can have kids, however. Those inmates who have kids often invest an inordinate amount of emotional weight in their relationship with them. Murderers, muggers and petty theives all get very upset at the idea of some jerk messing with their own kids while locked away and unable to intervene. They will therefore tend to exorcise these fears by wailing on the first child-hurter they can find \"inside\". This is why all of the child molestors and kid killers go directly into \"Punk City\" (Protective Custody). This is where all those nasty types show up, along with those inmates who have been caught ratting someone out. Here, they are kept in a cell for 23 hours per day, with only the single hour for a shower and exercise. Separated from the main population, the \"punk\" inmate sees only his peers, the scum of the earth. This is the future awaiting the waste of flesh this article was written about.

Examining the places where Ron Paul and the ACLU disagree almost always shows Dr. Paul on the side of limited federal powers, following the constitution, and focusing on individual rights, not group rights.\n\nFor example, he opposes the recent political feel-good trend of passing so-called \"hate crimes\" legislation, since all crimes should be punished equally regardless of the gender, race, or sexual orientation of the victim. He opposed a federal law requiring equal pay by employers, because it would create a vast new bureaucracy that would second-guess every employer's wage determinations, eliminating the ability of employers and employees to mutually negotiate and agree on a wage. The ACLU supported both of these unconstitutional items.\n\nI like what the ACLU says it stands for, and I support them in defending Communists and Nazis alike.

For some, it's the glue that binds our molocules into coherent form, or it could also be the the better part of our human nature. In short, there's a \"something\" that's above and beyond, keeping everything organized. It's all up to us humans to come to terms with this \"whatever\" on our own terms. For instance, as a deist, I believe that organized religion is the greatest of folly and tragedy, as it deprives the supplicant of reason and replaces contemplation with a cardboard \"God\", srtuck in man's image -- and just as angry and bigoted.

A lot of systems are not capable of managing large binary blob drivers that are most likely not optimized for whatever purpose the machine in question has (think embedded devices).\nHave you thought about API rewrites? Did you know that Linux has undergone three rewritings of the USB API and because of that it has the fastest, most optimized stack of all known operating systems? Windows has had to rewrite it as well. Problem is, it has to hold all three API instances in memory at all times.\n\nSure, you can say that Solaris has a stable API and it does just fine, but Solaris was designed to run on large servers with proprietary-friendly features and with only two target architectures (unlike the dozens of subarchs Linux supports), so speed is a secondary concern at best, much like AIX or HP-UX. But then again you're not going to be recompiling those any time soon.\n\nThe biggest difference between Linux and its competitors is that it's not a monoculture and it never expects to be one, so you can't rely on default architectures, default compilers, default flags, default use cases, etc. Binary drivers would be an advantage for many uses, but they violate basic principles of what Linux is used for and who it caters to.

Because they believed what they wanted to believe, the invariable practice of all humanity.  \n\nThat said, while I don't personally know Tom Ricks, I do personally know several of his colleagues at the Post, at the LA Times, NYT and several other major metro dailies.  Here's the deal; contrary to what the far left would have us believe, they are almost overwhelmingly good people who honestly try to get it right the first time in incredibly hard situations where the facts are rarely clear-cut until after the smoke clears.

The truth is that you have absolutely no idea of what happens in the newsrooms of the major dailies.  And don't get the wrong impression; the right is just as bad if not worse.  It's a crock.  The so-called mainstream news media outlets can't give you everything; the world is simply too complex and the days when we as citizens could be spoon-fed the facts are long gone, if they ever existed at all.

One can look at it as a modest kind of disunion - a loosening of the bonds that tie disagreeing parties together.\r\n\r\nThe progressive reaction (my reaction) to the right wing noises Paul makes (low taxes, states rights, religion) is due to the cynical way in which Republicans have exploited these issues (and others like patriotism, family, etc) to pursue a radical corporatist, authoritarian agenda.  So the whole heap of right wing ideas smells a little badly at this point.\r\n\r\nTaking Paul's policies in their totality, however, does indeed seem to point at a different vision: unyoking the states from each other, each to pursue its own ways.  A weaker Federal government, lower *Federal* taxes, lower military spending, abolishment of the CIA, lower federal social programs.  If his policy is to devolve these functions to the states (rather than religion), it would sound attractive to progressives, I think.  I'm sure there are many blue staters who would be happy to let the red states go (and pay) their own way: in a sense to allow each state to compete in the market of opportunity.  Red staters can bloviate all they want about the coasts, but they'll be eating economic dust if that's what it comes down to.  I'm sure progressives would be quite happy to place their bets on their home turf.   \r\n\r\nWhat I would like to know is -- what are RP's ideas about corporations?  Should they enjoy the kind of robust personhood they do today?  Should they shield their owners from liability?  What protections do the poor have from the wealthy?  The Government is at least, in theory \"ours\"; whereas wealth and corporations are private (and increasingly owned by a smaller number of people).  Taking away Federal power without addressing this other issue seems a recipe for a new kind of disaster ([which seems already underway](http://www.amazon.com/Shock-Doctrine-Rise-Disaster-Capitalism/dp/0805079831 )).  Who will then be then be the gatekeepers - corporations, private security?  Not an attractive vision.  Were I to hear a clear populist statement from RP on such issues, I could really change my mind.        "},{"author":"kris58luke","body":"Children Halloween Costume\n\nChildren Halloween Costumes are outfits worn on or around October 31, the day of Halloween. Halloween is a modern-day holiday originating in the Pagan Celtic holiday of Samhain (in Christian times, the eve of All Saints Day). Although popular histories of Halloween claim that the practice goes back to ancient celebrations of Samhain, in fact there is little primary documentation of masking or costuming on Halloween before the twentieth century.[1] Costuming became popular for Halloween parties in America in the early 1900s, as often for adults as for children. The first mass-produced Halloween costumes appeared in stores in the 1930s when trick-or-treating was becoming popular in the United States. \n\nWhat sets Children Halloween Costumes apart from costumes for other celebrations or days of dressing up is that they are often designed to imitate supernatural and scary beings. Costumes are traditionally those of monsters such as vampires, ghosts, skeletons, witches, and devils. There are also costumes of pop culture figures like presidents, or film, television, and cartoon characters. Another popular trend is for women (and in some cases, men) to use Halloween as an excuse to wear particularly revealing costumes, showing off more skin than would be socially acceptable otherwise.\n"},{"author":"pets_or_meat","body":"Sometimes I upmod things I don't understand, simply because I don't understand them."},{"author":"frunt","body":"Downmodded as this just links to a nothing blog post that is little more than an image link itself.\n\nThe actual posters are here: http://www.tululuka.net/alco/"},{"author":"derekg","body":"Connection pooling is a big win but having a common abstraction layer that can cross multiple languages is also pretty helpful. \nBeing pure textual representation offers easier caching scenarios.

I also remember the [*declaration* of war](http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/myths/matsum_1.html) made by Japan against the United States, making it rather a moot point whether the attack was *considered* an act of war. So that's not a terribly illustrative example.\n\nYour point is accurate: a strategic air attack is usually *considered* an act of war. The Constitution, however, says nothing about this matter. The words \"act of war\" do not appear in that document. The sum total of its language that we're arguing about is in Article 1, Section 8:\n\n&gt; The Congress shall have Power... To declare War...\n\nThat's it.\n\nWe're talking about the power to *declare* a state of war. Not to wage it, not to order specific attacks, not to command troops. Just to declare that a state of war exists.\n\nNowhere does the Constitution say that the president (who \"shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States\") has to go to Congress to get permission to use that Army and Navy to attack a target, whether or not a declaration of war has been issued.\n\nMaybe you're under the misimpression that the military can't use force unless Congress issues a formal declaration of war. You're welcome to try to back that up with a citation. Presidents have been ordering the U.S. military to point its guns without a declaration of war almost since the Constitution was ratified. \n\nAnd even if air strikes were a power granted only to Congress, it wouldn't matter, since Congress ceded this right to the President in 1973 (with conditions). Go read the [War Powers Act](http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/warpower.htm):\n\n&gt; The President **in every possible instance** shall **consult** with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities...\n\n&gt; In the absence of a declaration of war, in any case in which United States Armed Forces are introduced into hostilities... the president shall submit within 48 hours to [Congress]... a report, in writing...\n\n&gt; Within sixty calendar days after a report is submitted... the President shall terminate any use of United States Armed Forces ... unless the Congress has declared war...\n\nCongress has given the president a 60-day \"bomb anything you want\" card. S/he is *requested* to consult Congress ahead of time but it is explicitly *not* required. S/he is required to write a report (\"what I did on my bombing vacation\"). There are a few other minor conditions.\n\nBut there is no question about it: the president is fully authorized to attack targets in Iran, and if the lawyers and generals say it's not \"possible\" to consult with Congress ahead of time, s/he doesn't have to.\n\nAgain, Romney is right, and Paul is wrong. The question was \"do you believe the president needs authorization of Congress to attack strategic targets in Iran.\" The correct answer is no."},{"author":"Tack122","body":" Luke:Oh no!

What's even worse, is they don't even bother to force a sale anymore. It used to be that an officer of the court would administer the sale of the property, the taxes would go to the government, and the homeowner would get the difference.

It's much easier to recover from edge error conditions when you don't have data structures in a half modified state. Erlang takes this concept to the logical end, and makes it possible to build extremely reliable systems.\n\nSo the thing about theses programming contests is they are completley geared to writing throw-away code.

The rivers were a thick toxic liquid which froze in Nifelheim. From these frozen river a mist rose, that turned to a cold rain that turned into white frost. Over long time, Ginnungagap was filled with this white frost, which was solid ice near Nifelheim and molten slag near Muspelheim. The drops from molten frost gained life near Muspelheim and formed into the giant Ymer. He was a frost giant and from birth evil. From the sweat of his left armpit when he slept a man and a woman grew forth, and his legs copulated and had a son, the forefathers of the frost giants.\r\n\r\nWhen the thawing continued, a cow emerged from the frost, she was called Adumla and Ymer lived fo the four rivers of milk that flowed from her. Adumla nourished by licking the frost of salty stones. Out of the stone, she licked during three days forth the shape of a man, who came to life. His name was Bure. He married a daughter of one of the frost giants and had thre sons, Oden, Vile and Ve.\r\n\r\nOden, Vile and Ve hated the frost giants and their ever-increasing numbers and brutal and barbaric ways. Finally they atatcked Ymer and slayed him. The blood pouring from his body drowned all the frost giants except Ymer's wife and the people of her farmstead.\r\n\r\nOden, Vile and Ve carried the body of Ymer into the middle of Ginnungagap and created the world from his body. His flesh became earth and his bones became mountains. His blood became lakes and seas. They lifted his skull and made the heavenly half-sphere from it. They placed a dwarf at each corner to guard the heaven, the dwarves were named Östre, Västre, Nordre and Södre (roughtly Easty, Westy, Northy and Southy). From sparks from Muspelheim they created the starts.\r\n\r\nThe brothers gave the remaining giants an area by the sea to live and called it Jotunheim. Since the the giants were still hostile, they took Ymer's eyebrows and made them into the walls of a fort. The fort they called Midgård. They tossed Ymer's brain into the skies were it became clouds.\r\n\r\nOne day Oden, Vile and Ve was walking along the shore and found an ash and an almtree that had washed ashore. From them they crafted man and woman. Oden breathed life into them and Vile gave them an understanding mind and a good heart, while Ve gave them hearing and sight. They gave Midgård for man and woman to live in."},{"author":"diatribal2","body":"exactly, this compares a relatively small british city with stockholm.... its a set up.  if they showed some London clubs, you'd be blown away by the hotness therein."},{"author":"WallPhone","body":"Here you go, [submit a patch](http://webpy.org/track/log/markdown.py?rev=170).

I happen to do all the layout myself &amp; email it off to the printers, but probably only because I enjoy it and because I'm ok at it - I don't *need* a graphic designer. Anyway, I work for myself, and have no employees, so the \"profits\" of my \"company\" are what you would call your \"wages\". $4000 is quite a whack of cash for me - I'd love to buy a new MacPro this year, or a new (secondhand) car and a fine like this would prevent me from doing so. So IMO it's quite a sufficient amount to discourage smaller companies such as mine from making a similar mistake in future.\n\nI have a customer with an office and a number of employees. They undoubtedly have a much larger turn- over than me, but nevertheless the company is managed by the owner and any increase in expenses affects what he takes home at the end of the year. This particular guy does have a nicer house than me &amp; a nicer car, but there are probably computer programmers &amp; accountants who make more. So I'm inclined to perceive the electronics store which was fined in this way, and that the fine might well have come out of the proprietor's pocket. You might not consider it enough, based on his estimated earnings, but it is his estimated earnings you should be basing your opinion on, not on whether or not he happens to be running a business. \n\nI know a number of owners of small businesses, all those I have in mind have employees, and none of those guys would consider $4000 to be a laughing matter.

You can legally cast these to and from some integer type, so the compiler can't reliably generate type information that the GC can use to know what words are pointers.\n\nOne response is \"conservative\" GC, which is a hack that assumes that any word that looks like a valid memory address is one.  It's unsafe because you can do arithmetic on pointers (if you have &amp;(a[5]) somewhere, it's not safe to collect a; if you have the xor of two pointers because you like tricky doubly-linked lists, it's not safe to collect either of the nodes you xored the pointers to).  It's leaky because sometimes you just happen to have a number that looks like an address.  A conservative GC also isn't allowed to move anything (it can't reliably find all the pointers to an object because some may be hidden, and there may be some false-positive ints lying around), so the heap can get fragmented.\n\nI think \"doing closures right\" includes the ability to return them.  To do this, you need some sort of data structure to keep the variables your function closes over.  In pseudo-C:\n\n    typedef int (*IntToInt)(int);\n\n    IntToInt MakeAdder(int increment) {\n      int adder(int x) {\n        return x+increment;\n      }\n      return adder;\n    }\n\nThis would fail, even with nested functions, because \"increment\" is allocated on MakeAdder's stack frame,\nwhich is freed when MakeAdder returns.

Trying to paint atheists as oppressed minorities is an insult to real groups of people who can't control their ethnic origins, and who have had to deal with real problems in history. Atheists have had equal rights throughout history, after all, they never had to tell anyone they were atheist. It's not like there's some atheist ceremony you need to do which would make it difficult to hide your atheism. It's the easiest system of non-belief there is. \r\n\r\nAnd Jews/Blacks/etc. have the same problems you describe, except they can't simply renounce their ethnicity:\r\n- We need security for synagogue services in most big cities.

So, if you want your beliefs to gain more main stream acceptance then REFREAIN from anger.

When a feature is complete they merge their branch into trunk and a release branch is cut.  That release branch is tested and patched as needed.  When it is ready for production someone pushed that branch to the live servers and merges and patches from the release branch back into trunk.  Trunk serves only as an integration point, but it is a centralized integration point which is important in a corporate environment.\n\nHowever, this is difficult in practice with VCS like svn which are fairly brain dead with respect to how they handle merging.  I use bzr to manage my home projects and it is refreshing to add version control to a project simply as 'bzr init'.

What exactly were you expecting? As you noted, SMP support is new to Erlang and it takes a bit of tweaking with the number of schedulers to find the sweet spot for a particular architecture, but as the Erlang developers get more experience with tuning for SMP and learning the gory guts of various systems' baroque threading policies this is bound to improve.  You still can't get around Amdahl's law, but Erlang makes it easier to get close to the limit without pushing you past the edge of insanity.\n\nErlang is not touted as a multi-threading language, it is touted as a concurrency language.  This means that it deals with multi-core and the much more common multi-node situation in a fairly transparent manner.  \n\nConnection points to Erlang systems, whatever that means, are also not as difficult as you suggest.  Few languages sling packets as well as Erlang, so the base level of interaction is to use a TCP/IP socket.  A port driver is pretty trivial to set up in Erlang but this ease comes at a speed cost.  If you are willing to trade reliability for speed then a linked-in driver is the way to go, but this is non-trivial unless you dive into one of the driver toolkits (which is only a small step easier than \"non-trivial\"...)  Fast FFI is definitely something Erlang needs, but to declare Erlang systems \"closed\" is quite inaccurate.

Such evil must be purged from Israel.  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)\n\n\nKill Homosexuals\n    \"If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives.\"  (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)\n\n Death for Hitting Dad\n\n    Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death.  (Exodus 21:15 NAB)\n\nDeath for Cursing Parents\n\n    1) If one curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out at the coming of darkness.  (Proverbs 20:20 NAB)\n\n    2) All who curse their father or mother must be put to death.  They are guilty of a capital offense.  (Leviticus 20:9 NLT)\n\n \n\nDeath for Adultery\n\n    If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death.  (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)\n\nDeath to Followers of Other Religions\n\n    Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed.  (Exodus 22:19 NAB)\n\nKill Nonbelievers\n\n    They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.  (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB)\n\n \n\nKill False Prophets\n\n    If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, \"You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.\"  When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through.  (Zechariah 13:3 NAB)\n\nKill Women Who Are Not Virgins On Their Wedding Night\n\n    But if this charge is true (that she wasn't a virgin on her wedding night), and evidence of the girls virginity is not found, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father's house.  Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.  (Deuteronomy  22:20-21 NAB)\n\nKill Followers of Other Religions.\n\n    1) If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or you intimate friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: do not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, but kill him.  Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you.  You shall stone him to death, because he sought to lead you astray from the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.  And all Israel, hearing of this, shall fear and never do such evil as this in your midst.  (Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB)\nInfidels and Gays Should Die\n\n    So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired.  As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies.  Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies.  So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever.  Amen.  That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires.  Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.  And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with women, burned with lust for each other.  Men did shameful things with other men and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly deserved.  When they refused to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their evil minds and let them do things that should never be done.  Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, fighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip.  They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful.  They are forever inventing new ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents.  They refuse to understand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving.  They are fully aware of God's death penalty for those who do these things, yet they go right ahead and do them anyway.  And, worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.  (Romans 1:24-32 NLT)\n\n \n\nKill Anyone who Approaches the Tabernacle\n\n    For the LORD had said to Moses, 'Exempt the tribe of Levi from the census; do not include them when you count the rest of the Israelites.  You must put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, along with its furnishings and equipment.  They must carry the Tabernacle and its equipment as you travel, and they must care for it and camp around it.  Whenever the Tabernacle is moved, the Levites will take it down and set it up again.  Anyone else who goes too near the Tabernacle will be executed.'  (Numbers 1:48-51 NLT)\n\n \n\nKill People for Working on the Sabbath\n\n    The LORD then gave these further instructions to Moses: 'Tell the people of Israel to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you forever.  It helps you to remember that I am the LORD, who makes you holy.  Yes, keep the Sabbath day, for it is holy.  Anyone who desecrates it must die; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community.  Work six days only, but the seventh day must be a day of total rest.  I repeat: Because the LORD considers it a holy day, anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death.'  (Exodus 31:12-15 NLT)\n\n\nYou forget, \"Thou shalt not kill\" is negotiable. Thou shalt not kill is more of something to do within your tribe. It's okay to kill people who don't believe the same thing as you.\n\nAnyway, all those things above are from the Old Testament. Some Christians say Jesus took care of this and does away with the Old Testament, WRONG. \nLooky at what Jebus says:\n1) “For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.”  (Matthew 5:18-19 RSV)  Clearly the Old Testament is to be abided by until the end of human existence itself.  None other then Jesus said so.\n\n2) All of the vicious Old Testament laws will be binding forever.  \"It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid.\"  (Luke 16:17 NAB)\n\n3) Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets.  He hasn’t the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament.  \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place.\"  (Matthew 5:17 NAB)\n\n3b) \"All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness...\"  (2 Timothy 3:16 NAB)\n\n3c) \"Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.\" (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)\n\n4) Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children according to Old Testament law.  Mark.7:9-13  \"Whoever curses father or mother shall die\"  (Mark 7:10 NAB)\n\nAnd MORE such tings.\n\n\nAll this from www.evilbible.com"},{"author":"HumanSockPuppet","body":"Do you think that atheism influences people to become more materialistic than they already are by natural compulsion?"},{"author":"theDrWho","body":"    it's not breaking when 20 other links have already been posted\n\ndown"},{"author":"J-Ro","body":"I'm not unbaised, but here's a try an unbiasedness:\n\nThe progam:\n\nSCHIP, state children's health insurance program.

More info at the wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children's_Health_Insurance_Program\n\n\nThe Democratic Stance:\n\nThe money goes overwhelmingly to help low income families insure their children. This is a good program.

This is a step towards socialized medicine. It takes people out of private insurance and puts them on government rolls.\n\n\nMy rebuttle:\n\na) The States do what the want with the money.

In states like New Jersey (which has been a battleground on this issue), the cost of living is high. Couple that with children with preexisting conditions (they are sick and will need a lot of treatment, and as such are bad business for insurers, who then charge higher premiums), it is certainly believable that a family making as much as $60k a year wouldn't be able to afford health insurance.

But on its face, it does prevent a challenge.  Let's put aside Gore's explanation that the house was in his family, that he purchases carbon offsets to diminish his carbon emissions, or that he has taken quite a number of steps to reduce the emissions created as a result of his house.\n\nYour point is that if he tore down the mansion and put in a more modest residence it would reduce the carbon emissions.  Or if he moved to a more modest house, his personal carbon emissions would be reduced even if the overall emissions would remain constant.  And you're right on each count.\n\nBut you're assuming something that Al Gore does not.  You assume that he believes climate change can be solved by reducing our consumption or by private initiative.  While clearly, he believes climate change will be solved by government action, innovation, and free enterprise.  And he is doing what he can to get this process started and to keep it going.  Al Gore does not believe that we need to reduce the amount of power we consume, that we need to radically change our lifestyles, but that we need to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from the power we use, or when possible, use less.\n\nAl Gore is not a hypocrite.  He just has different ideas about how to solve these problems.  As far as his own personal responsibility for his carbon footprint goes, he believes he must take what reasonable measures he can to reduce it.  That doesn't mean selling his family's mansion though.  You can quibble with the decision, and debate where he draws the line, but Al Gore is not a fraud or a hypocrite because he is not advocating for anyone else what he himself is not doing.\n\nI think Al Gore is a good man because he handled defeat with dignity, because he appears to have principles that animate his thinking and public statements, because his judgment remained unbowed by the humiliation of the 2000 election loss, and because he was still willing to put himself out there and try to change the world for the better after this loss."},{"author":"fartron","body":"That's at most a quarter of a car"},{"author":"metmerc","body":"This is why I now define Christianity and Christ Follower as separate things.\n\nA Christ Follower follows the teachings of Jesus and has faith in salvation through him.

We have kept accurate records (climate) for the past 100 years or so, for the most part. Certainly we have had accurate records over the past 50. The ice is melting. This is not a debatable point. The global temperatures are slightly higher. This is not a debatable point. Ice is going away and temperatures are higher than what we had been recording in the past (although, it is a very limited amount of time for the data that we have).\r\n\r\nI agree with you so far.  Although [the recent error in global temperatures that was revealed recently](http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/13830/) actually shows 1934 as the hottest year in the batch, but I'll agree that it has been ever-so-slightly hotter globally in recent years.\r\n\r\n&gt;It may be pure coincidence that we happened to be spitting chemicals into the air and this is occurring in our climate. I am willing to accept that, because we haven't been fully industrialized for very long (100-500) years is a blink for this planet), so these things may have occurred at the same time with no relationship. Seems kinda strange they are occurring at the same time, but that is not proof.\r\n\r\nExactly. We are still on the same page pretty much.\r\n\r\n&gt;But I'm not really arguing that it is man made or that we can have an impact one way or the other. \r\n\r\nOk, we are still very much in agreement.\r\n\r\n&gt;There used to be days in LA county where they told you not to go outside (this may still occur) because the smog was so bad and it was unhealthy. \r\n\r\n[LA County is an unusual geographic phenomenon that makes the smog much worse than it would be otherwise.](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E3DC1131F931A35750C0A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print)  But to be sure, you pack THAT MANY people in a single place and you are going to be far more likely to overload the system.  LA is one of the most densely populated cities on Earth.  Without a doubt it will be worse than most places.\r\n\r\n&gt;Have you seen pictures of the cloud above China!? Again, I don't know if this is effecting out climate, but it certainly isn't healthy.\r\n\r\nNo, what is the story on the cloud above China? But you bring up an interesting point that is one of my beefs with Kyoto and other plans:  Many developing countries get a pass, even though they are probably committing the worst offenses when it comes to carbon emissions.\r\n\r\n&gt;I wish the global warming stuff would just go away (the hype) and everyone could catch their breath and just agree that we have to modify our actions with respect to what we throw into our environment.\r\n\r\nI also like the idea of being more \"green.\"  I don't like it being legislated based on bad science.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I have put a bunch of those compact flourescent bulbs in my house.  Lowe's and Home Depot are pushing them like crack.  They cost more, but it is within my affordability and tolerance ranges.  So I buy them.  And it looks like they are selling them pretty well.\r\n\r\nPeople will make the changes naturally when given the option at a reasonably affordable price.  We don't need the government to force one-size-fits-all solutions on businesses based on dubious science.\r\n\r\nI'm ok with tax credits and incentives for companies to be greener.

If the government can't even figure out what chads are out of the ballots in an election and can't do anything about an education system that is falling behind, whyt *would* you want them running your healthcare, telling doctors how to treat people, and mandating prices (which is the easiest way to destroy innovation?)

Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.”  (Matthew 5:18-19 RSV)  Clearly the Old Testament is to be abided by until the end of human existence itself.

He hasn’t the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament.  \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place.\"  (Matthew 5:17 NAB)\n\n3b) \"All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness...\"  (2 Timothy 3:16 NAB)\n\n3c) \"Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.\" (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)\n\n4) Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children according to Old Testament law.  Mark.7:9-13  \"Whoever curses father or mother shall die\"  (Mark 7:10 NAB)\n\n5) Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not washing his hands before eating.

Hating queers/ rejecting science/ stifling questions and dissent... that's not the true faith. People who do that aren't real (Christians/ Jews/ Muslims/ Hindus/ etc.).\n\nSorry, but any doctrinal system involve distinctions, not recognizing these distinctions is foolish. Do we lump all insects together when we study them biologically? Do we lump all spiders together? This is not a logical or legitimate complaint. We examine both difference and similarities, this is the essence of not just modern science but common sense.\n\n&gt;I don't think any of you have it right. To me, it all looks like something that people just made up.\n\nSo according to the author, none of the belief systems of the world have any value at all. Perhaps all societal successes within these belief systems are somehow accidental? Thousands of years of human progress and apparently none of it came from any religious insight anywhere! Not a remotely defensible view.\n\n&gt;How the hell do they know which parts of the Bible/ Torah/ Koran/ Bhagavad-Gita/ whatever God really meant, and which parts he didn't?\n\nSo this assumes an equivalence. There is no equivalence between these texts, they are not the same and they do not have remotely the same origins. According to the author's previous statements all of these religions must be equally wrong. However there is no equally itemized condemnation of Muslims, Hebrews, or Buddhists, all of which in areas of dominance have equally fervent believers. Rather her ire is directed uniquely at Christians and particularly the red fabric used by this administration, which is designed to invite exactly this kind of attack. Hence my invitation to examine the structural problems related to the vast majority of her complaints, rather than just retreating to a lazy blanket condemnations. Sure some of these religions occasionally get an check off in the also ran category as indicated in the other cited paragraph, but no serious examination has been done in this essay.\n\n&gt;And if they don't know, if they're just basing it on their own moral instincts and their own perceptions of the world, then on what basis are they thinking that God and their sacred texts have anything to do with it at all?\n\nSo I think we have to look at the societal successes that organize religions yield the world over. Not a hard case to make. If they didn't provide some societal benefits, there would be no religions. Thousands of years of social evolution have not washed them out.

Yet this is something we might all agree is a valuable moral to have in our society. Thus its an explicit moral, given to us by the religion.\n\nI like this as a defense of atheism not having morality. You can explain implicit morality as something we all experience since birth, like hurting others that we visible see in pain and then contrast that with an explicit morality we learn that isn't obvious to us.

They could not legally and unilaterally leave the estate land and abandon their hereditary obligations to their lord.  If a serf attempted to run way permanently from his estate, the lord had the right to give pursuit and forcibly return and punish him.*\"\n\nWhile the *mi ser* could own property and had limited judicial recourse against mistreatment by their *sger pa* (which was apparently exercised only rarely), this is basically human slavery.\n\nTibetans living under the Chinese occupation certainly don't have it good, but Tibet before the Chinese occupation wasn't exactly pastoral either.
